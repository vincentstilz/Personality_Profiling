# Personality Profiling

## Description
This repository contains the Python script "Assignment_1_Final_Code.py", which is the result of converting the "Assignment 1 Final Code.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook. The script includes data manipulation, analysis, and visualization steps tailored for a specific dataset.

## How to Run
To run this script, you will need Python installed on your system. Clone this repository, navigate to the cloned directory, and execute the script using Python. Ensure that you have all the required dependencies installed.


## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: The script includes steps to clean the dataset, such as handling missing values and incorrect data types.
- **Data Analysis**: It performs statistical analysis to understand correlations between different student demographics and their performance.
- **Visualization**: Utilizes matplotlib and pandas for generating various charts and plots, providing visual insights into the data.
- **Customizability**: The code is structured to allow easy modification for analyzing different datasets or adding new analysis metrics.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have Python 3.6 or newer installed on your machine. The script relies on several third-party libraries:

- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: For numerical operations.
- matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
python Assignment_1_Final_Code.py
```
## Dependencies

The script depends on several Python libraries, including pandas, matplotlib, and numpy. You can install these dependencies using pip:
```
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
```
Ensure your data files are correctly placed or update the file paths in the script accordingly.

## Data Structure

The script expects an Excel file containing student demographics and performance data, structured with specific columns like 'Age', 'CAO Points', and 'Daily travel to DCU'. It performs various analyses, including:

Distribution of ages and CAO points.
Impact of travel distance on academic performance.
Visualization of exam results across different demographics.

## Customization

The script is designed for easy customization. You can modify the data file path, add new columns for analysis, or adjust the visualizations to fit your dataset.
